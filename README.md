<h2>How are we building it?</h2>

Creating a project of this magnitude requires extensive time dedicated to developing the architectural framework and meticulous planning. It's essential that everything functions as intended, ensuring optimal performance and stability.

For this project, we've selected Rust as our programming language of choice, given its reputation as one of the finest languages currently available.

#### Runtime Environment

Our architecture leverages the Actor model (currently utilizing a library, with plans to transition to a bespoke runtime). You can discover more about the Actor model [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model).

Utilizing the Actor model built on the Tokio Runtime allows us to operate thousands of actors without compromising performance. To illustrate, imagine managing 200 devices in your home, each device typically necessitates 2 to 3 actors for monitoring and control. This scenario would result in 600 actors actively running in your core system to manage 200 devices, and we're still well below the system's actual capacity (We've successfully operated ~12,000 active actors on a MacBook M1 without any difficulties).

Our system employs a priority-based mechanism, ensuring that critical actors are initiated first to immediately allocate the necessary resources.

Additionally, actors facilitate cluster formation, enabling the deployment of multiple Sync instances to create a high-availability system. For instance, two Sync instances could be configured to work in tandem, achieving 99% uptime for critical resources.

#### Integration with External Vendors

Integrations enable the addition of data to your Sync instances through external vendors. For instance, if you own 2 Samsung TVs, a Tado HVAC system, and a Philips Hue lighting system, you would have 3 integrations (Samsung, Tado, and Philips Hue) managing numerous components (the total number of your devices), with each integration, like Samsung, controlling its respective components. The choice of communication protocol by an integration, such as Zigbee, is seamlessly supported.

#### Data Management Strategy

We're enthusiasts of the SurrealDB project and have integrated its embedded version into our system. SurrealDB stands out with its impressive performanceâ€”crucial for managing and updating vast amounts of data. It also supports live updates, meaning every interface connected to the Sync core receives data updates instantaneously.

To manage the potential voluminous data generated by devices, we've decided to store only the latest update while producing valuable analytics data. Those requiring comprehensive data storage can activate an integration for direct data saving in various formats.

#### Automation

Our runtime and efficient data management systems significantly simplify automation processes. This streamlined system reduces the workload by facilitating the automatic control and management of devices, making automation effortlessly achievable.

#### AI Model Development

The development of AI models is currently ongoing, and the architecture for this component is yet to be determined.
